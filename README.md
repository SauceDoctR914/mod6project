After creating a notebook a user can click the notebook link to display that particular notebook's page. Once there, they can create a new note which is initialized with a title, the date created from a drop down, a brief description of the note, and the note content. After a note is created, the user may edit that note, delete the note or even translate that note into over 100 different languages!
